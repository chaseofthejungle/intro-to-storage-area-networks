Two popular options for network-based storage include Storage Area Networks (SANs) and Network-attached storage (NAS). Advantages of network-based storage include the potential for multi-user collaboration and data sharing, multi-device data accessibility, and off-site storage potential (such as for storing secure data and backups of data and systems).

| *Consideration* | *SAN* | *NAS* |
| :---: | :---: | :----: |
| User Count | Intended for Multiple Users/Potential High Scalability | More Likely to Have Scalability Issues |
| Device Count | (Often) Multi-Device Network | (Usually) Single Storage Device, Implemented with RAID or Other Redundant Storage |
| Learning Curve | More Complicated | Less Complicated |
| Costs | More Expensive | Less Expensive |
| Speed | Faster | Slower |
| Expandability | High Potential | More Limited in Comparison |
| Cabling | Fibre Channels (FCs) | TCP/IP Ethernet |
| Storage System | Block-based | File-based |
